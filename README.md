# Waifu Speech
Waifu Speech is a program for changing voices into female anime voices.

### How does Waifu Speech work
<img src="/assets/images/structure.png" />
If you look at the diagram there are 4 processes in this program. Because Voicevox only supports Japanese, it needs to change the text of the audio that we previously processed into Japanese

### How do I run this program
To run this very simple program, you need Python version 3.7++ because this program uses Python, so make sure you have Python installed on your computer.

#### Install modules
- Windows, Linux, Mac
``` konsole
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*  I'm not sure it will work on all platforms but you can give it a try. I tried it on linux

If already installed
``` konsole
python3 main.py
```
or
``` konsole
python main.py
```
(I'm using the first method because im using python 3.xx)
